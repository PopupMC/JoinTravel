## Join Travel

When a new player joins it executes these 3 commands as console

- /weather main sun
- /time set day main
- /asl travel-w-command {player} menu-nplayer

This clears the weather, resets the time to sunrise, and /travels the player,
and opens up a new player menu after player has been teleported.

It would be as if the player had started a single player game except with the
perks of a server and the ability to go to /spawn whenever they desire.

Normally I would fill out a lot of into here but this is an internal plugin
so maybe later.
